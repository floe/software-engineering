# Software Engineering lecture materials

## Preface

This repository contains lecture materials (mostly slide sets) for an undergraduate course in software engineering. This course was initially held at Bauhaus-Universität Weimar in the winter semester 2014/15. Prerequisites are basic knowledge about fundamentals of computer science and good skills (theoretical as well as practical) in C++.

Where possible, I have tagged material from external sources with CC (also under a compatible CC license), PD (public domain material) or FU (material which I believe to be included as "fair use"). I've found that it's at times quite difficult to find suitable CC-compatible materials for inclusion, which is why I'm doing a "rolling release" - every time I've converted a new slide set, I will add it to the repository. Comments, feedback and suggestions for improvement (including pull requests) are very welcome.

## Contents

The course currently spans 11 weekly sessions with the following topics:

* Introduction
* Best Practices
* Software Processes
* Agile Methods
* Design Patterns Part 1
* Design Patterns Part 2
* Code Quality
* Build Systems
* Requirements Engineering
* Testing & CI
* Open Source Software

The course is usually accompanied by an exercise class every two weeks. As the exercise materials are part of the graded course assignments, I'm currently not including them in this public release.
